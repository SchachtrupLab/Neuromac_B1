Inspect the number of uniquely expressed genes per cell to determine
whether the number of variable features we selected (2000) is
reasonable. I think we want to aim for
\textasciitilde median(nFeature\_RNA).

We test SCTransform method of normalization + variable feature
selection. Purpose of this is to evaluate how cluster results compare to
initial result, given that there are some microglial clusters that
cannot be validated (i.e. Developmental MG {[}Krt genes{]}, and Unknown
MG {[}``GM-''{]}).
